## **MY RESUME TEMPLATES**

### **Introduction**
---
This is the repo to store my personal resume template, including English and Chinese versions. In the English version, a cover letter is also included. The template is customized accordding to [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

The basic structures and styles are kept unchanged, but the some parts of the original [class file](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV/blob/master/awesome-cv.cls) have been rewritten with fonts changed, and added the publication section template. All the fonts involved are self-contained in the fonts folder.

### **How to Use**
---
#### *Build the Project*
A full TeX installation is required. You can choose to use [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/). Because the [*fontspec*](https://github.com/wspr/fontspec/) package is used, the project should be compiled using [XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) or [LuaTeX](http://www.luatex.org/), where [XeTeX](https://tug.org/xetex/) is recommended. The build command is as follows:

```shell
$ xelatex resume.tex
```
This will output the final pdf file.
